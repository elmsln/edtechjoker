## Git

Git is the largest and most well known version control tools that is used by a large base of people. It also has a important feature of collaboration which allows various people to all be working on one source. So this makes working in a team much easier in terms of writing code. Git saves changes when they are made to files and these changes are known as "Commits" . The next step would be called a "pull request" which would work as a way you could let your team know your code is ready to review and if you decide it is good to go you can add it to your codebase.

Git can be used via

## Docker
Think of Docker like a special box filled with building blocks, the kind you'd use to make awesome stuff like houses, cars, or robots. You know how building things is fun, but redoing them exactly the same way can be a bit of a chore? Well, Docker comes to the rescue! It's like a super-efficient building block organizer. You can store all the specific blocks you need in this virtual box, and when you want to build something again, Docker helps you put them all together effortlessly.

Now, picture programmers using Docker as a magical tool to build software apps. It's like a secret weapon that simplifies the whole process – creating, launching, and managing apps becomes a breeze. Just like your building blocks make creating things more enjoyable, Docker makes the lives of programmers easier by letting them focus on making amazing software without all the usual complications.
